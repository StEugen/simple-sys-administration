# How-to-set-up-jupyter
This is just my experience in jupyter (notebook and hub) set up

So, the story is short, one day I had to install jupytehub on local university server (yup, i'm system administrator in my university). I should admit that at first I actually saw no difference between jupyterhub and just jupyter notebook, it seemed to me as an extended version of jupyter notebook. So, that's the reason why I wrote an instruction for jupyter notebook too.

Well, i made a virtual debian server to make it more mobile, in case something will crash and also it's my first experience in making jupyterhub, so I decided to make it in virtual environment though I'm quite a linux user and see no problem in using shell instead of GUI. Sooo, all you need before you go through the instruction is that I used Debian 11 bullseye.
